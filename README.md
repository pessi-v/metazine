# Introduction

**Metazine** (from the Greek μετά, _meta_, meaning 'after' or 'beyond' - an adjective meaning 'more comprehensive' or 'transcending', and _magazine_ - a periodical publication) is an experimental RSS/Atom feed client built as a Ruby on Rails app. It tries to present feed entries as articles of a unified online publication.

Features already in:

- Feed validation
- Newspaper-like presentation of articles
- Search across all articles
- In-app reader view for articles using the @mozilla/readability JS library
- In-browser text-to-speech service for articles
- Federation with AcivityPub

Features I'll add when I have time:

- Article translations
- Article summaries
- Article tags
